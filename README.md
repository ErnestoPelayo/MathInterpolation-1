What are the interpolation methods?
-----------------------------------

+ 1.-Linear
  ---------   
    In mathematics, linear interpolation is a method of fitting curves that use linear polynomials to
    construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.

+ 2.-Single polynomi.
     ---------------
    Polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a data set given by the polynomial of the lowest possible
    degree that passes through the data set points.

+ 3.-Lagrange
    ---------
     In numerical analysis, Lagrange polynomials are used for polynomial interpolation. For a given set of points (Xj,Yj)
     with no two Xj values equal, the Lagrange polynomial is the polynomial of lowest degree that assumes at each
     value Xj the corresponding value Yj (i.e. the functions coincide at each point).

+ 4.-Newton
    --------
    This method is useful for situations that require a low number of points to interpolate, since as the number of 
    points grows, so does the degree of the polynomial

+ 5.-Spline
    ------
    Spline interpolation is often used because it results in similar results requiring only the use of low-grade 
    polynomials, thus avoiding oscillations, undesirable in most applications, found by interpolating through 
    high-degree polynomials.
